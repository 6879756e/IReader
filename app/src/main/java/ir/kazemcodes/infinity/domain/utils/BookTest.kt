        """Ao Longyu, who had been hurrying along, saw a familiar figure descend into the Mental Demon Purgatory from afar.

She was stunned.

Then, she surged forth with all her strength.

She headed towards the place where the figure landed.

She didn’t care about anything else and didn’t think too much about it. She only wanted to grab that falling figure.

Lin Siya was surprised to see her Senior Sister suddenly move.

“Senior Sister, what’s wrong?”

She immediately followed.

But she could not keep up with her Senior Sister’s speed at all.





She was too fast.

…

Jiang Lan had already made plans for the future, but the sudden appearance of the figure surprised him.

Initially, he had thought that these people would be bold enough to follow him in order to snatch some Dharma treasures.

True birds die for food and humans would die for wealth.

But when he saw the figure clearly, he was stunned.

It was… the most familiar face.

Although her face was cold, there was a hint of anxiety in her eyes.

“Senior Sister?”

Unfortunately, Xiao Yu had rushed over at this moment.

It ruined his plan.

Except…

He felt strangely… happy.

Or perhaps it was a feeling of rejoice?

It was indescribable.

Jiang Lan watched as Ao Longyu approached the abyss. In order to speed up, she even transformed into a white dragon.

Jiang Lan had already reached the depths, and Xiao Yu followed closely behind.

Seeing Xiao Yu transform, he realized that she was a snow-white dragon.

Her chest was flat.

Indeed, was the little Xiao Yu her true appearance?

Roar!

A dragon’s roar sounded.

Xiao Yu quickly arrived in front of Jiang Lan. As soon as she got close, she immediately returned to her normal appearance. The two of them faced each other and fell into the abyss together.

“What is Senior Sister doing?”

After dispersing the dark aura around Xiao Yu, Jiang Lan asked.

“I’m here to save Junior Brother,” Ao Longyu replied softly.

They were less than a foot apart.

He could touch her with his hands.

“Does Senior Sister have the confidence to go back up?” Jiang Lan asked curiously.

Ao Longyu lowered her brows and remained silent.

Just now, the situation was desperate and she couldn’t think, so…

She forgot to consider that she couldn’t go back up.

“I won’t hide it from Senior Sister.” Jiang Lan looked at Ao Longyu.

“I came down willingly by myself. Even the entrance to the Netherworld does not affect me so I am perfectly fine here. I have originally planned to find Senior Sister after getting rid of them. Who knew that Senior Senior Sister would come down by yourself. “

Ao Longyu looked at Jiang Lan in annoyance.

And the mark on her cheek was barely visible.

Jiang Lan didn’t care about this.

The mark was like a scar. It was formed in the Third Summit’s mystic realm.

In retrospect, if he had made a move earlier…

His Senior Sister wouldn’t be injured.

However, who would have thought that this day would come?

Where was this mark when she transformed into a dragon?

Could it be on her face?

He did not see it just now.

Xiao Yu was a white dragon. If there really was a mark, it would make it even more obvious.

With this thought in mind, Jiang Lan reached out his hand and placed it on Ao Longyu’s back.

Ao Longyu slowly pressed down, and in the time it took to breathe, Ao Longyu was pressed against Jiang Lan’s body.

She was surprised and her body stiffened.

But she didn’t do anything.

“Senior Sister, don’t move. Hold onto me tightly. I’ll bring Senior Sister up. “

Jiang Lan carried Xiaoyu in his arms and began to move, turning into a standing position.

Ao Longyu hugged Jiang Lan.

After making sure Ao Longyu was hugging him tightly, Jiang Lan stood on his tiptoes and leaped up.

Out of the abyss.

In the Mental Demon Purgatory, countless black qi wanted to keep Jiang Lan, but none of them could catch him.

At this moment, Jiang Lan had changed his direction and didn’t intend to appear where he had just landed.

If he chose to do so, the troubles would continue to follow him.

Woosh!

The wind howled.

Jiang Lan shifted his position and headed towards the front.

Then, he jumped onto the platform.

He landed slowly.

After calming down, he retracted his hand.

Ao Longyu also released her grip and retreated a few steps.

Her ears were a little red, but she still looked at Jiang Lan.

It felt like she was trying her best to look at him. The aloof her would never avoid his gaze.

However, after Jiang Lan stared at her for a long time, Ao Longyu subconsciously shifted her position.

Jiang Lan: “…”

“Junior Brother, do you think there’s anyone nearby?” Ao Longyu asked softly.

Jiang Lan looked around and shook his head.

“I don’t think so.”

When he turned around, Ao Longyu had already shrunk in size. She looked at him angrily.

“Junior Brother, I think we need a duel. Only by doing so will it calm the anger in my heart.”

“Senior Sister, if you were the one who fell, do you want me to jump down?” Jiang Lan looked at Xiao Yu and asked.

He asked calmly.

Upon hearing this question, Xiao Yu thought carefully and whispered.

“I hope, but I don’t want you to either. Thus, I hope that there would be someone who pulled you back before you jumped. If you don’t intend to jump… I feel sort of desolate.”

Xiao Yu paused and looked at Jiang Lan.

“Junior Brother, will you jump?”

“I will jump down without hesitation, even if I cannot face any dangers below.” Jiang Lan’s gentle voice sounded without any hesitation.

“I’m several realms stronger than Junior Brother. It must be me who will save you. Junior Brother doesn’t have such an opportunity anymore.” Xiao Yu stared at Jiang Lan as she spoke.

There was a smile in her voice.

She was cheerful and lively.

She loved to boast.

Jiang Lan looked at her and didn’t refute. He wanted to help Xiao Yu see if there were any problems left on her body.

Just as she was about to act, black lines appeared on Xiao Yu’s body. It was the black lines of the Mental Demon Purgatory.

After the black lines appeared, a light followed.

It was the light that signaled her exit.

“Senior Sister, you seem to have been eliminated.”

Jiang Lan reached out and cleaned up the black light.

Xiao Yu’s fall into the Mental Demon Purgatory was originally unsolvable, but she had already come out. In theory, she was already out of danger.

However, she was judged to be eliminated.

It was because the black qi could not be completely dealt with and would leave behind dangers on her body.

Because of this, she had been eliminated.

He had planned to check on Xiao Yu.

Naturally, Xiao Yu saw it too. She was calm.

“I am eliminated because I was trying to save Junior Brother.” As she spoke, she took out a squarish Dharma treasure and handed it to Jiang Lan.

“Master gave this to me. I think that Junior Brother is coveting my treasures which is why you haveeliminated me.”

With that, Xiao Yu returned to normal.

Jiang Lan glanced at Ao Longyu’s chest.

He was trying to guess where it would be on the white dragon.

Gauging from the position of her hands, they should be slightly below her front claws.

“I should be out a bit later.” Jiang Lan told Xiao Yu that he would stay for a while longer.

With that said, he took the Dharma treasure Ao Longyu handed him.

“Good luck, Junior Brother.”

Ao Longyu looked at Jiang Lan before disappearing on the spot.

His Senior Sister had been eliminated.

Jiang Lan was left alone.

He could now do many things since he was alone.

There would be no restrictions.

However, Jiang Lan didn’t plan to do anything now. He wanted to wait.

Because the beasts had yet to enter.

Just as Jiang Lan was about to leave, he saw someone walking over.

It was Senior Sister Lin.

“Junior Brother Jiang?” Lin Siya looked around and said.

“Where’s Senior Sister?”





“Senior Sister has just left the tower,” Jiang Lan said softly.

Lin Siya naturally understood what it meant to leave the tower.

“Does Junior Brother Jiang have any plans for the future?” Lin Siya did not ask about Senior Sister.

This was a matter between her Senior Sister and Junior Brother.

If she asked too many questions, it might make the other party feel uncomfortable.

However, this place was too dangerous for Jiang Lan.

Jiang Lan was about to speak, but she suddenly saw a light flash from Senior Sister Lin’s body. It wasn’t just Senior Sister Lin, but he also had one on him.

“I plan to leave this floor,” Jiang Lan said.

Now, he planned to take a look at the upper level. When the light flashed, he discovered that his control over the Deity Position had increased slightly.

Perhaps this place would allow him to control his Deity Position faster.."""
